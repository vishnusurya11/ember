# Project EMBER

Project Ember is an automated pipeline that generates short stories and transforms them into fully produced videos. The project uses various AI-powered modules to generate story scripts, create audio narrations, generate images, and finally compile them into a video.

Project Ember automates the creation of narrative videos by integrating several key components:

- **Story Generation**: AI-based generation of short scripts.
- **Prompt Generation**: Produces detailed prompts for each sentence in the script, which are used to generate images.
- **Audio Generation**: Converts the script into an audio narration.
- **Image Generation**: Generates images based on the prompts using a pre-configured AI model.
- **Video Generation**: Combines the generated images and audio to create a video.

The process is modular, allowing each component to be improved or swapped out as technology advances.
