#             - **Character and Conflict Development**: Assess if the characters’ actions, emotions, and motivations align with the details provided and contribute meaningfully to the story’s overall progression. Examine whether the main conflict is introduced effectively and if it holds the reader's attention throughout, building naturally toward a resolution.

#             - **Logical Try-Fail Cycles and Tension Progression**: Confirm that each attempt made by the character builds tension logically, without explicitly using cues like “yes, but” or “no, and.” Each try-fail cycle should feel integrated and immersive, moving the story forward in a way that remains aligned with the character's motivations and the story's stakes. Note if any attempt feels forced, illogical, or disrupts the continuity of the narrative. Each cycle should relate to a MICE thread—whether it focuses on Milieu, Inquiry, Character, or Event—and contribute meaningfully to that thread’s progression and resolution.

#             - **MICE Structure Adherence**: Evaluate whether the story structure follows the MICE Quotient, incorporating Milieu, Inquiry, Character, and Event threads as necessary. Assess if each element serves its purpose within the narrative to deepen reader engagement and emotional impact. Provide feedback on whether the story weaves these elements naturally or if any parts feel disconnected from the MICE framework.

#             - **Continuity and Flow**: Check that each part of the story flows smoothly, with each action and consequence making logical sense given what has come before. The narrative should remain immersive, without any interruptions or breaks in continuity. Ensure that the prompt maintains a coherent thread and that events unfold naturally, adding to the story’s emotional engagement.

#             - **Strict Formatting for Continuous Flow**: The final story should be delivered as a single, uninterrupted block of text. Avoid any extraneous labels, subheadings, or cues that might break immersion.

#             Offer specific, actionable recommendations to improve clarity, logical progression, emotional depth, and alignment with the MICE structure. Ensure the feedback enhances the story’s alignment with the intended theme and sustains reader immersion.

Your task is to develop a richly immersive narrative for each story beat, focusing solely on how the main character overcomes each obstacle on their journey toward the ultimate goal.

            Guidelines:
            - Use the provided beats, associated MICE thread, and other key details (urgency, importance, stakes) as the foundation for the story, and use the plot to hint at the overarching world and larger goal.
            - Aim for approximately 500 words for each beat, creating a narrative that focuses on sensory-rich details, emotional stakes, and character depth to fully engage the reader.
            - Structure each beat with 4-5 try-fail cycles, where each attempt to solve the problem brings the character closer to the main conflict's resolution while increasing the tension.
            - Ensure that each try-fail cycle naturally advances the narrative and escalates the stakes, immersing the reader in the character’s evolving emotions and challenges.
            - Emphasize how the current task ties into the main character’s larger goal, subtly implying the urgency and stakes of the overall story. Use details that build the world and suggest the broader significance of the main character’s actions, without detracting from the present beat.
            - Strictly limit the story to the main character alone, with no other characters involved at any point. Focus entirely on the main character’s actions, decisions, and internal struggles.
            - Avoid using labels or explicit cues such as "Yes, But" or "No, And." Instead, write the narrative as a continuous flow without breaking immersion.
            - Conclude each beat with a clear, emotionally resonant moment, either resolving the beat or shifting the character's perspective in a meaningful way.

            Responding to Feedback:
            - If critique is provided, analyze it closely, incorporating specific suggestions to enhance the depth of sensory details, emotional resonance, pacing, or any other aspect as needed.
            - Double-check that all feedback points are fully integrated, ensuring the final narrative is refined and effectively aligns with the user’s input.
            - Review the story carefully for consistent use of the provided character name, ensuring no other characters are mentioned. If any extraneous characters appear, provide feedback to strictly remove them and maintain focus on the main character's solo journey.

            Return only the story narrative for each beat, written as a continuous, immersive block of text with no extraneous headings or labels. Each beat should stand alone, capturing a complete segment of the story’s progression, centered solely on the main character.
